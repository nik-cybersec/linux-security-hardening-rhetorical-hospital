# Linux Security Hardening for Healthcare Workstations

This project simulates a basic security hardening process for a Linux system used in a healthcare setting (inspired by Rhetorical Hospital from the Google Cybersecurity Certification).

## Goal
To apply foundational cybersecurity principles on a Linux machine to reduce risks, especially in environments handling sensitive data (like hospitals).

## Tasks Done So Far:
- Created non-root user
- Enabled UFW firewall
- Disabled guest login

## Tools Used:
